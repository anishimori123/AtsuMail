# Changelog

## v0.1.0 — 2026-11-01 — time spent: ~30 min

**What changed**
- First version: read-only Gmail reader that runs in the browser.
- Folder tree from Gmail labels (system folders first, then your own, with sub-folders).
- Explorer-style "Details" list: From / Subject / Date, unread in bold, "Load more" button.
- Reader view: one thin info line, then the email fills the rest of the screen. On phones the list hides while reading.
- Dark mode, Windows Explorer look, blue status bar.
- Demo mode with fake emails when no Client ID is set.
- Can be added to the phone home screen (manifest.json).

**Why**
- Gmail's app wastes space; the goal is maximum email content on a phone screen.
- Started read-only so nothing can be broken or deleted by mistake while learning.

## Ideas for later
- Stay signed in longer (needs a small free server, e.g. Cloudflare Workers).
- Mark as read / archive / delete (needs a bigger Gmail permission).
- Search box.
- "Force dark" switch for designed emails.
- Reply / compose.
